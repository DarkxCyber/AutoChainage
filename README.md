# AutoChainage
An AutoLISP tool for AutoCAD that calculates and labels chainage values along polylines in 0+000 format — perfect for civil and road alignment drawings.

## Overview  
**AutoChainage.lsp** is a lightweight AutoLISP utility designed for civil engineers and CAD professionals.  
It allows users to quickly **calculate and label chainages (in the 0+000 format)** on selected polylines — perfect for road design, alignment marking, or route planning.

## Features  
• Select any polyline in your drawing  
• Pick a point on or near the polyline  
• Automatically calculates chainage distance from the start point  
• Displays the chainage value as text (e.g., *3+45.67*)  
• Text automatically aligns with the tangent direction of the line  
• Simple and fast command execution 

## Command  

**`CHCHK`** - Prompts the user to select a polyline and pick a point. It then displays the chainage value and places the corresponding text at that location.

## How to Use  
1. Open **AutoCAD**.  
2. Type `APPLOAD` in the command line.  
3. Load the file **AutoChainage.lsp**.  
4. Run the command by typing:
   `CHCHK`
5. Select a polyline and click on or near it.
6. The chainage value will appear at that point with proper rotation.

## Installation  
- Copy **AutoChainage.lsp** into your AutoCAD support folder or any preferred directory.  
- You can also set it to **autoload** by adding it to your `acaddoc.lsp`.

## Example Output  

- Polyline selected...
- Picked point chainage: 3+45.67 m
- The text “3+45.67” will appear automatically at the picked location, aligned with the tangent of the polyline.
